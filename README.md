# TheDinitzProblem

Here is a simple-sounding coloring problem,
raised by Jeff Dinitz in 1978, which defied all attacks until its astonishingly
simple solution by Fred Galvin.

Consider n^2 cells arranged in an (n x n)-square, and let (i, j) denote the cell in row i and column j. Suppose that for every cell (i, j)
we are given a set C(i, j) of n colors.
Is it then always possible to color the whole array by picking for
each cell (i, j) a color from its set C(i, j) such that the colors in
each row and each column are distinct?

Here the solution that based on Fred Galvin solution
